Detailed Notes
Flags:

g: Global match (finds all matches).
i: Case-insensitive match.
m: Multiline match (affects ^ and $).
Others like s, u, and y are advanced and less common.
Difference Between match and matchAll:

matchAll() provides an iterator that includes detailed info for all matches, even with the g flag.
Use matchAll if you need indices or more details for global matches.
